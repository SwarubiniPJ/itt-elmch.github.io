      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> As AD is to this date an unstoppable fatal disease, many question the benefits of rehabilitation. This leads to a lack of multidisciplinary rehabilitation care for AD patients, despite it being often recommended.

    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b> AD-specific comprehensive rehabilitation approach: </b> As the WHO states, rehabilitation is also for those with detriments in function linked to ageing - and thereby also for AD patients. Resources should be made available to create comprehensive rehabilitative interventions as it has been shown that rehabilitation can achieve patients’ nominated goals, can delay functional decline and may delay admission to residential car.

      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> If rehabilitation becomes a more significant part of the medical procedure for AD, more medical personnel needs to be involved – but already today is a lack in professional care givers.

    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>Humanoid robots for rehabilitation efforts: </b>Humanoid robots can be used to support medical staff and caregivers by taking various tasks. Current research tests robots that can have engaging conversations with AD patients, recognize emotions or entertain the patients with songs and games. Prospectively, non-pharmaceutical therapies such as music and physio-motor therapy could  be facilitated via robots as well.  </td>

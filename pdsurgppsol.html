      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;"> Treating PD, like many neurological disorders, is complicated by the need of medications to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Additionally, PD patients are faced with the effects of their therapeutics to “wear-off” with time

    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b>3D printed drug delivery implant: </b> A 3D printed titanium transcutaneous bone-anchored port is implanted behind the patient’s ear. This port connects the catheters implanted into target areas within the brain to the external administration kit. This technology has several benefits: medication does not need to pass the BBB, novel drugs usually requiring infusion can be administered at home instead of a hospital setting and wearing-off effects can be reduced by a constant flow of drugs

      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;" rowspan="2">Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment of PD if medication cannot control the motor symptoms adequately. However, side effects may occur, and improvement is only about 30 to 60%.

    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;" > <b>Intra-operative imaging guidance:  </b>Traditionally, patients are awake during DBS surgery. However, it has been found that surgery on an asleep patient with imaging guidance shows greater improvements in cognition, communication, speech, and dyskinesia and less difficulties with speech fluency.

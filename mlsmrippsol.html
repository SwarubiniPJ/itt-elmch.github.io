      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">Conventionally, physicians and radiologists rely on experience and manual pattern recognition when evaluating MRI images, which could be time-consuming and prone to error.

      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1" rowspan="2"> The course of the disease in a single person can vary significantly over time also considering the number and size of inflammatory lesions. This makes judgements about the progression of MS difficult

      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"><b>Global symptom mapping model:</b> By applying machine learning to patient brain imaging data, a computational model was created that maps the symptoms of AD to the brain’s anatomy in a conceptual, color-coded framework. Prospectively, this might help to find new approaches in understanding, diagnosing and treating AD.

The platform also provides integrated clinical decision support and creates personalized action plans for each patient.

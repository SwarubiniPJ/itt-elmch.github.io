      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1" rowspan="2">Symptoms of AD can be manifold and often overlap with other neurological disorders, making diagnosis, monitoring and treatment difficult.</td>
      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"><b>Global symptom mapping model:</b> By applying machine learning to patient brain imaging data, a computational model was created that maps the symptoms of AD to the brain’s anatomy in a conceptual, color-coded framework. Prospectively, this might help to find new approaches in understanding, diagnosing and treating AD.

<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"><b>Digital Twin platform:</b> Digital twins are virtual representations of individuals bringing together data from brain scans, behavioral studies, lifestyle surveys and clinical studies. These complete and highly-detailed simulations will facilitate innovative brain research and more accurate and personalized decision-making for the individual patient.

  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1">  A cheap and fast way of screening for mental decline is the paper-based clock-drawing test. However, this test cannot tell which type of dementia is involved or if the loss of cognition is due to other reasons.
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>iPad-based dementia identification platform:</b> Based on the clock-drawing test, this digital platform uses AI to analyze both a patient’s final clock drawings and their drawing process, delivering greater sensitivity. The platform also provides integrated clinical decision support and creates personalized action plans for each patient.

  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> In the process of diagnosing AD, many tests are applied and clinicians from different disciplines are involved, making an efficient way of sharing information a necessity.
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>Electronic health records (EHRs) :</b> Via securely sharing and enabling quick access to health information, EHRs help clinicians to more effectively diagnose patients, reduce medical errors, and provide safer care. Research has also shown that great potential lies in EHRs: by developing tools detect patients with undiagnosed dementia or help foster a deeper understanding of the disease progression via big data analyses.

<tr>
  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> Reliably differentiating between normal cognitive aging and neurodegenerative disorder requires qualified specialists. Yet, access to those is often limited, especially in rural regions.

</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>Deep learning for Alzheimer’s disease assessment: </b>Machine learning models can process multimodal clinical data to accurately perform a differential diagnosis of AD. Such systems can support medical personnel to establish the correct diagnosis. Especially in resource-poor areas, ML algorithms could also be used as a first screening method, based on easily to attain, novel screening parameters such as retinal photographs.

<tr>
  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> There is an urgent need for an effective treatment of AD. But efforts to develop a drug that modifies Alzheimer's disease by using antibodies to clear amyloid-beta (Aβ) from the brain, have been so far unsuccessful.
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>Treatment with Lecanemab : </b>Lecanemab is a monoclonal antibody, that recognizes protofibrils and prevents amyloid beta deposition in AD. The drug passed phase 3 trials showing efficacy for patients with mild cognitive impairment: After 18 months of treatment, lecanemab reduced cognitive decline, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes compared to a placebo.

  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> While still under development, devices that measure brain activity could allow monitoring the progression of AD remotely, but such devices are yet too impractical and have a low sensitivity.
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1"> <b>Wearable EEG Patch : </b>A stretchable and transparent biocompatible electrode could in future be employed to measure brain activity and other related parameters such as pulse waves and blood oxygen saturation. This could help to continuously and remotely monitor AD as well as related health issues, like impaired sleep.

Upon receiving basic patient data like symptoms, demographics, and lab test results, smart algorithms can analyze the information and return a list of possible conditions and relevant recommendations.

  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1" rowspan="2"> To this day, PD remains a clinically defined disease. Diagnostic approaches may be subjective as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes.
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1" > <b> Wearable sensor: </b> Sensors can help to measure postural instability, gait or balance impairment. Continuous, 3-D recorded representation of movements occurring while performing tasks will help to characterize the deficits of Parkinson’s disease in the specific patient

  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;"> Levodopa is the most common medication to increase dopamine concentrations in the treatment of PD. Unfortunately, as the disease progresses, patients begin to experience “off episodes” as the effects of levodopa wane between doses
</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b> Opicapone: </b>Opicapone is taken once daily to prolong the “on” time of levodopa. It blocks the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) selectively and reversibly, increasing the concentration of levodopa in the bloodstream.
 </td>

<tr>
  <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1;font-size:16pt;"> In order to assess the impact of medication in PD patients, mostly their memory or diary entries are used. Considering the gaps between doctor visits, these are neither objective nor very reliable

</td>
<td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b>Whole body kinematics: </b>This research approach uses a full body wireless inertial sensing-based motion capture system which is worn by PD patients while doing physical tasks at home. This way, clinically meaningful reports from kinematic data that show changes after drug adjustments can be made.

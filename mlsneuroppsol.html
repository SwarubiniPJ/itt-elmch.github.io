      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;"> In about 90% of patients, MS begins with a relapsing course. It might be difficult for patients and doctors to detect and classify early symptoms and stages of MS, respectively
    </td>
    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b> IoT-enabled wearable sensor: </b>It detects the onset of MS using a biomarker and sends real-time data to the HCPs. AI integrated into the storage platform used by HCPs could support in classifying the stage of MS in patients

      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">Patients do not easily have access to or understanding of their diagnosis and treatment plans. There is no sufficient exchange of information between patients and care providers

It would implement clinical pathways in a manner which is comprehensible for patients.

    <tr>
      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">The huge variety several hundred genes correlated with the onset of MS makes understanding the disease and developing new therapy options very difficult
    </td>
    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b> Bioinformatics and integrated proteomics/metabolomics:</b> There are no protein markers approved for MS. New approaches are being developed through bioinformatics, proteomics or gene expression analyses, to help understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Based on this knowledge, new biomarkers and drug targets can be found leading to new treatment solutions and personalized medicine



   </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">MS is a highly heterogeneous disease with large inter-individual differences in disease course. A “one fits all” treatment plan is therefore insufficient in providing the best possible care for each patient.

    </td>
    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b>Deep phenotyping and digital twins: </b> Deep phenotyping is the comprehensive analysis of phenotypic traits. Using this data, a digital twin paired to the patient’s characteristics can be created which can be used to simulate multiple treatment methods. This helps in determining a more personalized and effective care.

    <tr>
      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">For treating relapsing-remitting MS, disease-modifying drugs are available. Due to the complex distribution of lesions, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of treatment with common low dimensional models.

    </td>
    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b>AI based model:</b>  AI-based model surpass the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the best conventional model, when it comes to detecting brain alterations occurring in response to treatment with disease-modifying drugs for MS

    <tr>
      <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:16pt;">None of the approved medications slow down or prevent disease progression in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), resulting in progressive worsening of functional mobility

    </td>
    <td class="tabletd" style= "background-color: #FED8B1; font-size:12pt;"> <b>MS PATHS:  </b> To help address variations, MS PATHS can be integrated into routine office visits at MS centers. Patient data is generated and collected for research in an efficient and standardized way so that subtle changes in various aspects of MS can be monitored accurately.
